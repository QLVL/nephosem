Nephological Semantics
======================

Welcome! This is the current home website of the Nephological Semantics Project,
developed in the QLVL research group at KU Leuven.
You can learn more about the project :doc:`here <about>`.

One of the main products of our project is Nephosem, a Python package with functions
to create type- and token-level distributional models, both with bag-of-words and
dependency information. You can also find here :doc:`the documentation <modules>`.
