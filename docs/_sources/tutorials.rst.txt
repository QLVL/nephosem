Tutorials
=========

This is a list of tutorials/vignettes to help you through the Nephosem package.
The links will take you to HTML rendering of Jupyter Notebooks; you can download
the corresponding notebook by replacing their ``html`` extension with ``ipynb`` or
by cloning `the tutorials repository <https://github.com/montesmariana/tutorials>`_.
In all cases, **replace the paths to the cloned repositories with your own**.
