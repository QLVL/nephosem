Aim of the project
------------------

The increasing importance of corpus data in linguistics creates a need
for appropriate methods for retrieving semantic information from corpora.
In this project, existing computational methods of distributional corpus semantics
are further developed in the form of a meaning detection approach based on token clouds,
i.e. clusters of distributionally similar attestations of words or expressions in a
multidimensional vector space. The first phase of the project has a methodological
orientation, focusing on the finetuning of such a 'nephological' method for detecting
linguistic meanings in corpus data. In the second phase of the project, the method is
put to use in two descriptive research lines: lectometrical research into the
relationship between language varieties, and variationist grammar research.
